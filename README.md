This project is about building a smart inventory system that behaves like a personal shopping assistant. Instead of making users place the same order again and again, the system remembers what they usually buy and helps them reorder it easily.

The system stores past orders, delivery addresses, and buying patterns of users. When a user logs in again, the AI looks at previous purchases and suggests the same or similar items automatically. For example, it may say, “Last month you bought milk, eggs, and bread. Do you want to reorder the same items?”

The user can simply confirm, edit, or cancel the suggestion. The delivery address and total amount are filled automatically, saving time and effort. The AI never forces an order — it only assists and waits for user approval.

As users continue to use the system, the AI learns their preferences and becomes more accurate in its suggestions. This helps users shop faster and also helps businesses manage inventory better by understanding demand patterns.

Overall, this project shows how Agentic AI can turn a regular inventory system into a helpful, intelligent assistant that reduces manual work and improves the user experience.
